   <p><u><h3>There are two types of players in the decision game</h3></u></p>
   <div> <font size="4"> 
      <ul>
      <li><b>Citizens</b>
      <ul>
      <li>Citizens are participants who take part in the typing task where you have to fill in 5 sequences of numbers and letters and earn <strong> 25 points </strong> (the task you just practiced). All participants who are assigned the role of citizen perform the exact same task.
     <li>40% of the points that are earned in the typing task are withheld and collected in a common account. You can think of these as taxes that citizens have to pay.
     </li>
     <ul><li> 40% of 25 points: <strong> 10 points </strong> </li></ul>
      <li>The remaining 60% are a citizen's personal earnings.
     </li>
     <ul><li> 60% of 25 points: <strong> 15 points </strong> </li></ul> 
      </ul>
      <li><b>Refugee</b>
      <ul>
      <li>The refugee (a participant in another study) does not participate in the typing task and therefore cannot contribute to the common account.
     </li>
      <li>The refugee has no own income.
      </ul>
     <li>The roles that are assigned in this decision task are fictional and do not necessarily correspond to reality.
      </p>
   </div>

   <p><u><h3>Each game consists of one refugee and two groups of four host citizens</h3></u></p>
      </ul> 
      <li>You have been assigned the role of a citizen. 
      <li>Each group consists of 4 citizens. You are one of the 4 citizens in a group. 
      <li>Each citizen from your group, including yourself, earns 25 points in the typing task.
      <li>Therefore, the total amount of points contributed to the common account of your own group is 40 points (4 x 10 points).
      <li>Each citizen from the other group earns 25 points in the typing task.
      <li>Therefore, the total amount of points contributed to the common account of the other group is 40 points (4 x 10 points).
      </ul>
